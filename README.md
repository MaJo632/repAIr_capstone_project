## About the project
Welcome to our innovative repair application, designed to empower you to troubleshoot all your appliances and devices with ease. Whether you're dealing with a faulty washing machine or a temperamental smartphone, this app will will put the power of repair in your hands!

## Overview
In this project, you will be able to interact with our bot to:
* diagnose the issue of your device or appliance
