If your battery is swollen, [[What to do with a swollen battery|take appropriate precautions|new_window=true]].\\n\\nThis guide instructs you to remove the front panel assembly; this is intended to prevent damage to the display cables. If you feel comfortable supporting the display carefully while peeling the battery out of the iPhone, you can skip the display removal and go directly to the battery removal steps.\\n\\n***For optimal performance, after completing this guide, [[Battery Calibration|calibrate]] your newly installed battery:*** Charge it to 100% and keep charging it for at least two more hours. Then use your iPhone until it shuts off due to low battery. Finally, charge it uninterrupted to 100%.\\n\\n***You can also use this guide to replace the following parts:***\\n\\n* [guide|29363|Battery Connector Bracket|stepid=132619]\\n* [guide|29363|Front Panel Assembly Cable Bracket|stepid=132622]\\n[video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtK7b_pqnCU]\\n\\n\\n###Tools Required:\\n\\n - Clampy - Anti-Clamp\\n\\n - Spudger\\n\\n - P2 Pentalobe Screwdriver iPhone\\n\\n - Suction Handle\\n\\n - iFixit Opening Tool\\n\\n - Tweezers\\n\\n - iOpener\\n\\n - Phillips #000 Screwdriver\\n\\n\\n###Parts Required:\\n\\n - iPhone 6 Battery\\n\\n - iPhone 6/6s/7 Battery Adhesive Strips\\n\\n - iPhone 6 Battery Connector Bracket\\n\\n - iPhone 6 Front Panel Assembly Cable Bracket\\n\\n\\n## Step 1\\nBefore disassembling your iPhone, discharge the battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.\\nPower off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.\\nRemove the two 3.6 mm-long P2 Pentalobe screws next to the Lightning connector.\\n\\n\\n## Anti-Clamp instructions\\nThe next two steps demonstrate the [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], a tool we designed to make the opening procedure easier. ***If you aren't using the Anti-Clamp, skip down three steps for an alternate method.***\\nFor complete instructions on how to use the Anti-Clamp, [guide|152309|check out this guide|new_window=true].\\nPull the blue handle backwards to unlock the Anti-Clamp's arms.\\nSlide the arms over either the left or right edge of your iPhone.\\nPosition the suction cups near the bottom edge of the iPhone just above the home button—one on the front, and one on the back.\\nSqueeze the cups together to apply suction to the desired area.\\nIf you find that the surface of your iPhone is too slippery for the Anti-Clamp to hold onto, you can [guide|159595|use tape|new_window=true] to create a grippier surface.\\n\\n\\n## Step 2\\nPull the blue handle forwards to lock the arms.\\nTurn the handle clockwise 360 degrees or until the cups start to stretch.\\nMake sure the suction cups [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BSluctHhVVqhGtfj.full|new_window=true|remain aligned with each other]. If they begin to slip out of alignment, loosen the suction cups slightly and realign the arms.\\nInsert an opening pick under the screen when the Anti-Clamp creates a large enough gap.\\nIf the Anti-Clamp doesn't create a sufficient gap, rotate the handle a quarter turn.\\n***Don't crank more than a quarter turn at a time***, and wait a few seconds between turns. Let the Anti-Clamp and time do the work for you.\\n***Skip the next three steps.***\\n\\n\\n## Manual Opening Procedure\\nIf you don't have an [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], use a single suction cup to lift the front panel:\\nPress a suction cup onto the screen, just above the home button.\\nBe sure the cup is pressed securely onto the screen to get a tight seal.\\nIf your display is badly cracked, [guide|103486|covering it with a layer of clear packing tape|stepid=193571|new_window=true] may allow the suction cup to adhere. Alternatively, very strong tape may be used instead of the suction cup. If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the broken screen.\\n\\n\\n## Step 2\\nWhile holding the iPhone down with one hand, pull up on the suction cup to slightly separate the front panel assembly from the rear case.\\nTake your time and apply firm, constant force. The display assembly is a much tighter fit than most devices.\\nUsing a plastic opening tool, begin to gently pry the rear case down, away from the display assembly, while continuing to pull up with the suction cup.\\nThere are several clips holding the front panel assembly to the rear case, so you may need to use a combination of the suction cup and plastic opening tool to free the front panel assembly.\\n\\n\\n## Step 3\\nPull the plastic nub to release the vacuum seal on the suction cup.\\nRemove the suction cup from the display assembly.\\n\\n\\n## Opening up the phone\\nOpen the iPhone by swinging the home button end of the front panel assembly away from the rear case, using the top of the phone as a hinge.\\nSeveral clips along the top edge of the front panel form a partial hinge.\\nDuring reassembly, align the clips just below the top edge of the rear case. Then, slide the front panel upward until its top edge is flush with that of the rear case.\\n\\n\\n## Step 5\\nOpen the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.\\nIn a pinch, an unopened canned beverage works well for this.\\nAdd a rubber band to keep the display securely in place while you work. This prevents undue strain on the display cables.\\n\\n\\n## Removing the battery connector bracket screws\\nRemove the following Phillips screws from the battery connector bracket:\\nOne 2.2 mm screw\\nOne 3.2 mm screw\\nDuring your repair, [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Magnetic-Project-Mat/IF145-167-4|keep track of each screw|new_window=true] and make sure it goes back exactly where it came from to avoid damaging your phone.\\n\\n\\n## Step 7\\nRemove the metal battery connector bracket from the iPhone.\\n\\n\\n## Disconnecting the battery connector\\nUse a plastic opening tool to gently pry the battery connector up from its socket on the logic board.\\nTake care to only pry up on the battery connector, and not the socket on the logic board. If you pry up on the logic board socket, you may break the connector entirely.\\n\\n\\n## Removing the front panel assembly cable bracket screws\\nRemove the following five Phillips screws securing the front panel assembly cable bracket:\\nThree 1.2 mm screws\\nOne 1.7 mm screw\\nOne 3.1 mm screw\\nIncorrect placement of these screws during reassembly will cause permanent damage to your iPhone's logic board.\\n\\n\\n## Step 10\\nRemove the front panel assembly cable bracket from the logic board.\\n\\n\\n## Step 11\\nIn the next four steps, take care to pry up '''only''' on the cable connectors, and not on their sockets on the logic board.\\nUse a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the front-facing camera and sensor cable connector.\\n\\n\\n## Step 12\\nUse a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the home button cable connector.\\n\\n\\n## Step 13\\nMake sure the battery is disconnected before you disconnect or reconnect the cable in this step.\\nUse a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the display data cable connector.\\nWhen reassembling your phone, the display data cable may pop off its connector. This can result in white lines or a blank screen when powering your phone back on. If that happens, simply reconnect the cable and power cycle your phone. The best way to power cycle your phone is to [guide|29363|disconnect and reconnect the battery connector|stepid=69537].\\n\\n\\n## Step 14\\nUse the flat end of a spudger to disconnect the digitizer cable connector.\\nWhen reconnecting the digitizer cable, '''do not press the center of the connector'''. Press one end of the connector, then press the opposite end. Pressing in the center of the connector can bend the component and cause digitizer damage.\\n\\n\\n## Separating front panel assembly and rear case\\nRemove the front panel assembly from the rear case.\\n\\n\\n## Step 1\\nPeel back the first battery adhesive tab from the bottom right edge of the battery.\\nUse your fingers or [product|IF145-020-4|blunt tweezers], and be extra careful when working near the battery—puncturing a lithium-ion battery can release dangerous chemicals and cause a fire.\\nOptionally, before proceeding further, you may [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/5rmsLbR3QbuptIyH|remove the two Phillips screws securing the vibrator|new_window=true] and lift the vibrator out to allow more clearance for extracting the battery strips successfully.\\n\\n\\n## Step 2\\nTry to keep the strips flat and unwrinkled during this procedure; wrinkled strips will stick together and break instead of pulling out cleanly.\\nSlowly pull the adhesive tab away from the battery, toward the bottom of the iPhone.\\nTo avoid tearing the adhesive strip, be careful not to snag it against the vibrator or other components near the battery.\\nPull steadily, maintaining constant tension on the strip until it slips out from between the battery and the rear case. For best results, pull the strip at a 60º angle or less.\\nThe strip will stretch to many times its original length. Continue pulling and re-grab the strip near the battery if necessary.\\nIf the strip breaks, carefully try to retrieve it with your tweezers (without damaging the battery) and continue pulling. If the strip breaks off underneath the battery and can't be retrieved, continue with the steps below.\\n\\n\\n## Step 3\\nRepeat for the second strip.\\nHold down the battery as you remove the second strip, or the strip may fling the battery when it separates from the case.\\nIf the adhesive breaks off underneath the battery and can't be retrieved, apply a few drops of high concentration (over 90%) isopropyl alcohol under the edge of the battery in the area of the broken adhesive strip(s).\\nWait about one minute for the alcohol solution to weaken the adhesive. Use the flat end of a spudger to gently lift the battery.\\nDon't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.\\n'''Do not''' pry against the logic board or you may damage the phone.\\n'''Do not''' insert the spudger in the area between the volume down (-) button and the top edge of the battery, or you may damage the [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/6nBtWNTDYIgDjHyM.huge|volume control cable|new_window=true] lying underneath.\\nFor more alternative methods when either of the adhesive strips broke off underneath the battery and could not be retrieved, '''continue with the next step below.'''\\n\\n\\n## Unstick the battery from the case\\nIf the battery remains stuck to the rear case, [guide|11677|prepare an iOpener] or use a hair dryer to heat the rear case directly behind the battery. It should be slightly too hot to touch comfortably.\\nThen, use a plastic opening tool to gently lift the battery.\\nOverheating the iPhone may ignite the battery.\\nAlternatively, if the battery remains stuck to the rear case, flip the iPhone back over and thread a piece of dental floss or strong string behind the battery. Then, slowly pull back and forth in a sawing motion to separate the adhesive.\\nA stronger alternative to floss is an unwound guitar string, such as a 0.009 E string from a 12-string set.\\n\\n\\n## Removing the battery\\nRemove the battery from the iPhone.\\nIf your replacement battery came in a plastic sleeve, remove the sleeve before installation by pulling it away from the the ribbon cable.\\nIf there's any alcohol solution remaining in the phone, carefully wipe it off or allow it to air dry before installing your new battery.\\nBefore you adhere the replacement battery, temporarily reconnect the battery connector to the logic board socket. This ensures that the battery is properly aligned in its recess.\\nAdhere the battery, disconnect it, and continue reassembling your device.\\nIf your new battery doesn’t have adhesive preinstalled, refer to [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+Battery+Adhesive+Strips+Replacement/56465|this guide] to replace the adhesive strips.\\nPerform a [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Force+Restart+an+iPhone+6/44408|hard reset] after reassembly. This can prevent several issues and simplify troubleshooting.\\nCompare your new replacement part to the original part—you may need to transfer remaining components or remove adhesive backings from the new part before installing.\\n\\n***To reassemble your device, follow the above steps in reverse order.***\\n\\nTake your e-waste to an [[E-Waste|R2 or e-Stewards certified recycler|new_window=true]].\\n\\nRepair didn’t go as planned?

A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.\\nPower off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.\\nRemove the two 3.6 mm-long P2 Pentalobe screws next to the Lightning connector.\\n\\n\\n## Tape over the display\\nIf your display glass is cracked, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping over the glass.\\nLay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's display until the whole face is covered.\\nThis will keep glass shards contained and provide structural integrity when prying and lifting the display.\\nWear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair.\\nIf the broken glass makes it difficult to get a suction cup to stick in the next few steps, try folding a strong piece of tape (such as duct tape) into a handle and lifting the display with that instead.\\n\\n\\n## Anti-Clamp instructions\\nThe next two steps demonstrate the [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], a tool we designed to make the opening procedure easier. ***If you aren't using the Anti-Clamp, skip down three steps for an alternate method.***\\nFor complete instructions on how to use the Anti-Clamp, [guide|152309|check out this guide|new_window=true].\\nPull the blue handle backwards to unlock the Anti-Clamp's arms.\\nSlide the arms over either the left or right edge of your iPhone.\\nPosition the suction cups near the bottom edge of the iPhone just above the home button—one on the front, and one on the back.\\nSqueeze the cups together to apply suction to the desired area.\\nIf you find that the surface of your iPhone is too slippery for the Anti-Clamp to hold onto, you can [guide|159595|use tape|new_window=true] to create a grippier surface.\\n\\n\\n## Step 2\\nPull the blue handle forwards to lock the arms.\\nTurn the handle clockwise 360 degrees or until the cups start to stretch.\\nMake sure the suction cups [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BSluctHhVVqhGtfj.full|new_window=true|remain aligned with each other]. If they begin to slip out of alignment, loosen the suction cups slightly and realign the arms.\\nInsert an opening pick under the screen when the Anti-Clamp creates a large enough gap.\\nIf the Anti-Clamp doesn't create a sufficient gap, rotate the handle a quarter turn.\\n***Don't crank more than a quarter turn at a time***, and wait a few seconds between turns. Let the Anti-Clamp and time do the work for you.\\n***Skip the next three steps.***\\n\\n\\n## Manual Opening Procedure\\nIf you don't have an [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], use a single suction cup to lift the front panel:\\nPress a suction cup onto the screen, just above the home button.\\nBe sure the cup is pressed securely onto the screen to get a tight seal.\\nIf your display is badly cracked, [guide|103486|covering it with a layer of clear packing tape|stepid=193571|new_window=true] may allow the suction cup to adhere. Alternatively, very strong tape may be used instead of the suction cup. If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the broken screen.\\n\\n\\n## Step 2\\nWhile holding the iPhone down with one hand, pull up on the suction cup to slightly separate the front panel assembly from the rear case.\\nTake your time and apply firm, constant force. The display assembly is a much tighter fit than most devices.\\nUsing a plastic opening tool, begin to gently pry the rear case down, away from the display assembly, while continuing to pull up with the suction cup.\\nThere are several clips holding the front panel assembly to the rear case, so you may need to use a combination of the suction cup and plastic opening tool to free the front panel assembly.\\n\\n\\n## Step 3\\nPull the plastic nub to release the vacuum seal on the suction cup.\\nRemove the suction cup from the display assembly.\\n\\n\\n## Opening up the phone\\nOpen the iPhone by swinging the home button end of the front panel assembly away from the rear case, using the top of the phone as a hinge.\\nSeveral clips along the top edge of the front panel form a partial hinge.\\nDuring reassembly, align the clips just below the top edge of the rear case. Then, slide the front panel upward until its top edge is flush with that of the rear case.\\n\\n\\n## Step 5\\nOpen the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.\\nIn a pinch, an unopened canned beverage works well for this.\\nAdd a rubber band to keep the display securely in place while you work. This prevents undue strain on the display cables.\\n\\n\\n## Removing the battery connector bracket screws\\nRemove the following Phillips screws from the battery connector bracket:\\nOne 2.2 mm screw\\nOne 3.2 mm screw\\nDuring your repair, [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Magnetic-Project-Mat/IF145-167-4|keep track of each screw|new_window=true] and make sure it goes back exactly where it came from to avoid damaging your phone.\\n\\n\\n## Step 7\\nRemove the metal battery connector bracket from the iPhone.\\n\\n\\n## Disconnecting the battery connector\\nUse a plastic opening tool to gently pry the battery connector up from its socket on the logic board.\\nTake care to only pry up on the battery connector, and not the socket on the logic board. If you pry up on the logic board socket, you may break the connector entirely.\\n\\n\\n## Removing the front panel assembly cable bracket screws\\nRemove the following five Phillips screws securing the front panel assembly cable bracket:\\nThree 1.2 mm screws\\nOne 1.7 mm screw\\nOne 3.1 mm screw\\nIncorrect placement of these screws during reassembly will cause permanent damage to your iPhone's logic board.\\n\\n\\n## Step 10\\nRemove the front panel assembly cable bracket from the logic board.\\n\\n\\n## Step 11\\nIn the next four steps, take care to pry up '''only''' on the cable connectors, and not on their sockets on the logic board.\\nUse a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the front-facing camera and sensor cable connector.\\n\\n\\n## Step 12\\nUse a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the home button cable connector.\\n\\n\\n## Step 13\\nMake sure the battery is disconnected before you disconnect or reconnect the cable in this step.\\nUse a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the display data cable connector.\\nWhen reassembling your phone, the display data cable may pop off its connector. This can result in white lines or a blank screen when powering your phone back on. If that happens, simply reconnect the cable and power cycle your phone. The best way to power cycle your phone is to [guide|29363|disconnect and reconnect the battery connector|stepid=69537].\\n\\n\\n## Step 14\\nUse the flat end of a spudger to disconnect the digitizer cable connector.\\nWhen reconnecting the digitizer cable, '''do not press the center of the connector'''. Press one end of the connector, then press the opposite end. Pressing in the center of the connector can bend the component and cause digitizer damage.\\n\\n\\n## Separating front panel assembly and rear case\\nRemove the front panel assembly from the rear case.\\n\\n\\n## Step 1\\nRemove the two 1.9 mm Phillips screws securing the home button bracket.\\n\\n\\n## Step 2\\nRemove the home button bracket from the front panel.\\n\\n\\n## Step 3\\nUse the point of a spudger to disconnect the home button cable connector by pushing it up and away from the home button.\\n\\n\\n## Step 4\\nThe rubber membrane surrounding the home button is very thin and tears easily.\\nApply mild heat (with an [product|IF145-198-2|iOpener], heat gun, or hair dryer) to soften the adhesive securing the home button membrane.\\nUsing your fingertip, apply firm, constant pressure on the home button from the front side of the display assembly, until the membrane starts to separate from the front panel.\\nDo not push the home button all the way through—you only need to get a corner free so that you can pry it free with a spudger.\\n\\n\\n## Step 5\\nPeel the home button the rest of the way off of the display by prying gently with a spudger.\\n\\n\\n## Step 6\\nUse the point of a spudger to carefully separate the home button cable from the adhesive securing it to the front panel.\\nIf the cable doesn't separate easily, apply heat using an [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Parts/iOpener/IF145-198-4|iOpener|new_window=true] or hair dryer to soften the adhesive, and try again. Be careful not to damage the cable.\\n\\n\\n## Step 7\\nOnce all the adhesive has been separated, remove the home button from the front panel.\\nIf you are replacing a broken front panel, there may be glass shards stuck to the home button. Carefully remove any remaining glass before transferring your home button to a new display.\\nYour replacement part may come with an [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/RBplrTYSIZiU3VDU|extra Phillips screw|new_window=true] already installed left of the Home Button. Remove the unnecessary screw so that you can reinstall the home button bracket.\\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.\"),\n",

With the \\'\\'\\'[guide|29206|iPhone 6 Plus|new_window=true]\\'\\'\\' laid out for inspection, we turn our attention to the smaller iPhone 6—though at 4.7\", it\\'s still a giant among iPhones. What was so big that Apple couldn\\'t fit it into the familiar form factor? Let\\'s shake it out onto the teardown table and find out!\\n\\nThis year we\\'re doing the iPhone 6 teardown in English, Français, Deutsch, Español, Italiano, Nederlands, Русский, and 中文.

Let\\'s check out some tech specs:\\nApple A8 processor with 64-bit architecture\\nM8 second-generation motion coprocessor\\n16, 64, or 128 GB onboard storage capacity\\n4.7-inch 1334x750 pixels (326 ppi) Retina HD display\\n8 MP iSight camera (with 1.5µ pixels and phase-detection autofocus) and a 1.2 MP FaceTime camera\\nTouch ID home button fingerprint sensor, barometer, 3-axis gyro, accelerometer, ambient light sensor\\n802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi‑Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 + NFC + 20-band LTE\\n\\n\\n## Step 2\\nWe stood in some pretty long lines to get our hands on the new curved iPhone 6, and we couldn\\'t be more excited to delve into it!\\nWe want to send out a big thanks to our good friends at [http://www.macfixit.com.au|MacFixit Australia|new_window=true] for letting us use their office in Melbourne for the teardown. They stock Mac and iPhone upgrades/accessories, and also carry our [product|IF145-072|iFixit toolkits|new_window=true]. Thanks MacFixit Australia!\\n\\n\\n## Step 3\\nApple has decided to brand this particular iPhone 6 as model A1586.\\nThe camera bump, as it\\'s widely known, is prominently visible along the top of the iPhone 6. Apple chose improved optics in exchange for a lens assembly that is slightly thicker than the rest of the phone.\\nJust how big is this bump you ask? Our calipers say about 0.6 mm.\\nYou win this time, optics.\\n\\n\\n## Step 4\\nThe rounded corner design of the iPhone 6 is very reminiscent of the [guide|599|first generation iPhone|stepid=3147|new_window=true], sans the Lightning connector and Pentalobe screws.\\nWith our [product|IF145-022|64 Bit Driver Kit|new_window=true], we proceed to remove the Pentalobe screws from the iPhone 6.\\nIt\\'s well known that we hate proprietary screws, but we\\'re happy that this iPhone won\\'t require any heating action to crack it open.\\n\\n\\n## Step 5\\nAll hail the [product|IF145-243|iSclack|new_window=true]. Opening phones in this fashion is so satisfying!\\nWe trust the iSclack enough to wave our shiny new iPhone in the air, but if and when you decide to try this at home, you should probably use two hands for safety.\\nWith the front panel assembly open, we take a peek inside the iPhone 6.\\n\\n\\n## Step 6\\nThis step may feature the improper use of a boomerang, performed either by professionals or under the supervision of professionals. Accordingly, iFixit must insist that no one attempt to recreate or re-enact any boomerang-related repairs performed during this teardown.\\nThis is how to boomerang, right? We spoke with several Australians, and they all came to the same conclusion. This is how you [http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma1xn5em6Z1qery84.jpg|boomerang|new_window=true].\\n\\n\\n## Step 7\\nWhile there may not be any Phillips screws on the outside of this phone, there are certainly Phillips screws on the inside. Fortunately, our [product|IF145-239|Pro Tech Screwdriver Set|new_window=true] can handle any type of screw this phone dishes out.\\nWith screwdriver in hand, we tackle the metal bracket screws that secure the front panel assembly in place.\\n\\n\\n## Step 8\\nWe peel the home button off the front panel assembly with ease—though, as ever, the surrounding rubber gasket is easy to tear if you don\\'t have the steady hands of a tech surgeon.\\n\\n\\n## Step 9\\nMuch like the iPhone 6 Plus, the front-facing camera and earpiece speaker reside on the front panel assembly.\\nWe pull them out and line them up for inspection.\\n\\n\\n## Step 10\\nSo far, the overall construction of this \"small\" iPhone 6 is a dead ringer for its big brother, the 6 Plus.\\nThis metal plate and the front panel assembly it covers are perfect examples. The [guide|29206|design mirrors that of the iPhone 6 Plus|stepid=69197|new_window=true], which in this case is a definite improvement.\\n\\n\\n## Step 11\\nWe love these battery pull tabs. Pulled correctly, they\\'ll save you the hassle (and potential hazard) of coaxing the battery out with a pry tool.\\nThis adhesive is similar to a 3M Command adhesive, and when you pull the tab correctly it shears the entire strip off.\\n\\n\\n## Step 12\\nThe iPhone 6 features an 1810 mAh, 3.82 V Lithium-ion Polymer battery with an energy rating of 6.91 Wh. Turning it over, the rating improves to 7.01 Wh! Perhaps the engineers were able to squeeze an extra 0.1 Wh in the battery after confirming the text on the front.\\nApple preaches that this 28-gram (3.75\" x 1.5\" x 0.13\") power pack will let you talk for up to 14 hours on 3G and offers 250 hours of standby time.\\nThis is a fair bit smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus\\'s 11.1 Wh, 2915 mAh battery—but still a notable bump from the 1560 mAh unit in the iPhone 5s.\\nThis battery seems to have an identity crisis. On the front are markings of Apple South Asia (Thailand) Limited and Apple Japan. On the back, it says it\\'s actually made in Huizhou, China.\\n\\n\\n## Step 13\\nGood news, everyone! The rear-facing camera is easily removed with a pair of tweezers.\\nThough it lacks the fancy optical image stabilization of the camera in the [guide|29206|iPhone 6 Plus|stepid=69107|new_window=true], this unit shares virtually all of its other specs: 8 megapixels, f/2.2 aperture, True Tone flash, and phase-detection autofocus.\\nIt also features electronic image stabilization, which aims to mimic the effects of OIS (optical image stabilization) using image processing techniques.\\n\\n\\n## Step 14\\nWe tweeze out antennas faster than you can remove punny parts from a [https://images.funagain.com/cover/huge/00919.jpg|buzzing board game|new_window=true].\\nWe master the \\'\\'operation\\'\\' and quickly move on.\\nUp next is the logic board.

We want to send out a big thanks to our good friends at MacFixit for letting us use their office. They stock Mac and iPhone upgrades/accessories, and also carry our [product|IF145-072|iFixit toolkits|new_window=true]. Thanks MacFixit Australia!\\n\\n\\n## Step 3\\nComing soon to a supermarket near you, the iPhone 6 Plus Pop-Tarts Bluetooth/NFC speaker.\\nThe iPhone 6 Plus measures in at 158.1 mm long, 77.8 mm wide, and 7.1 mm thick. Quite literally [http://www.chacha.com/question/what-are-the-dimensions-of-a-poptart|bigger than a Pop-Tart|new_window=true].\\nAt 7.1 mm, it\\'s the thicker of the new crop of iPhones—but thickness is the one dimension in which it undercuts [guide|17383|last year\\'s iPhone 5s|new_window=true], which measured 7.6 mm.\\n\\n\\n## Step 4\\nJust like the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 6 Plus is available in three different [http://33.media.tumblr.com/c1f798f252f242386cdeaa37a39681e4/tumblr_nbnqmkvGVb1qzx3jto1_500.png|colors|new_window=true]: Silver, Gold, and Space Gray. Of course we went for the Gold.\\nThe iPhone 6 Plus is identified by its model number: A1524.\\nMuch to the [http://www.zdnet.com/apples-appalling-iphone-6-camera-compromise-7000033612/|distress|new_window=true] of some reviewers, both iPhone 6 models feature a noticable camera \"bump\". It seems that Apple was unable to shave enough thickness off of the camera sensor to keep it flush with the rest of the chassis. The lens cover may be made out of sapphire glass, but we\\'re still concerned about what this design choice might mean for durability.\\nMuch like the [guide|23615|HTC One M8|new_window=true], the iPhone 6 Plus features two plastic antenna stripes on the outer case. These stripes help with wireless reception that would otherwise be blocked by an all-metal outer case.\\n\\n\\n## Step 5\\nIt seems Apple is reluctant to switch from Pentalobe screws to good ol\\' regular Phillips screws. Luckily, we brought our [product|IF145-239|Pro Tech Screwdriver Set|new_window=true] to remove those pesky Pentalobe screws.\\nWhile proprietary screws are not our favorite, we are happy that we don\\'t have to go straight to heat.\\n\\n\\n## Step 6\\nIt\\'s [product|IF145-243|iSclack time|new_window=true]! This handy tool allows us to easily shuck the display assembly from the rear enclosure.\\nWe proceed cautiously, remembering the [guide|17383|surprise|stepid=52330|new_window=true] from last time.\\nWith no noticeable booby traps, we proceed to open our little gold treasure chest.\\nApple\\'s rerouting of the Touch ID sensor cable recalls the cleaner design (and safer opening procedure) of the iPhone 5—the iPhone with the [https://www.ifixit.com/smartphone_repairability|highest repairability score] to date.\\nMuch like iPhones of the past, the display assembly cables are held securely to the logic board by a metal bracket.\\n\\n\\n## Step 7\\nWith the display assembly removed, we get our first look at the innards of the iPhone 6 Plus.\\nThe internal layout of the iPhone 6 Plus appears to be similar to the 5s, but we immediately notice the sheer size of the battery. Based on its volume alone, we suspect the iPhone 6 Plus will be no slouch when it comes to battery life.\\n\\n\\n## Step 8\\nThe home button assembly is secured by a metal bracket. Removing the bracket allows us to simply pop the home button off the front panel assembly.\\nThis design is on-par with [guide|24983|last year\\'s home button]—modular, if a bit time-consuming to get to in the event of a repair.\\n\\n\\n## Step 9\\nThe front-facing camera is part of a larger cable assembly, which includes the earpiece speaker, microphone, and ambient light sensor. Both reside on the front panel assembly.\\n\\n\\n## Step 10\\nNext we decide to remove the metal plate from the front panel assembly.\\nIn a big win for repairability, Apple has completely redesigned how the home button connects to the main board. Gone is the [link|https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/liGxTLGCNPv2XIMO|awkwardly short and fragile cable] of the iPhone 5s days. Instead, Apple has made the effort to run the home button cable all the way to the opposite end of the phone. We\\'re quite happy to see this improvement!\\nWe can\\'t think of a reason to extend the cable this way except to improve repairability. Thank you, Apple.\\n\\n\\n## Step 11\\nThe next logical step is to remove the battery from the iPhone 6 Plus.\\nThe battery connector is covered by a metal bracket, which we dispose of using our metal [product|IF145-020|tweezers].\\nNear the bottom of the battery, we locate some sticky pull tabs.\\nHere\\'s what we know about sticky iPhone battery pull tabs: pull it right, and it is super easy; pull it wrong, and it is the end of the world.\\nThis adhesive is similar to a 3M Command adhesive, and when you pull the tab correctly it shears the entire strip off.\\n\\n\\n## Step 12\\nAfter saying the magic words, the 43-gram, 4.7\" x 1.9\" x 0.13\" battery mystically lifts off the rear case enclosure.\\nIn line with rumors, the battery is rated at 3.82 V and 11.1 Wh of energy, for a total of 2915 mAh—nearly double the capacity of the 1560 mAh unit in the iPhone 5s, and slightly larger than the 2800 mAh burner in the Galaxy S5.\\nBetween the [http://xkcd.com/1422/|larger battery|new_window=true] and improvements in power efficiency, Apple touts a talk time of up to 24 hours on 3G, and 384 hours of standby time.\\nThe battery found in the Plus is larger than the standard iPhone 6\\'s 6.91 Wh, 1810 mAh battery—which explains the [http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/16/iphone-6-and-6-plus-review/|longer life|new_window=true], despite the much larger screen.\\n\\n\\n## Step 13\\nThis is new!
